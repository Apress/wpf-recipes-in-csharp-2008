This readme file accompanies the source code for the Apress book "WPF Recipes in C# 2008" by Sam Noble, Sam Bourton, and Allen Jones.

The source code was developed using Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition and targets the Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5. At the time of writing, Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition was available free of charge from http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp and the Microsoft .NET Framework was available from http://www.microsoft.com/net/Download.aspx.

The source code for each chapter is in its own folder and organised as a single solution containing one project for each recipe in that chapter. All multimedia files used in the recipes are included as part of the recipe project.

To access the source file for a recipe, browse to the appropriate chapter folder and open the .sln file using Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition. You can then view, edit, and execute the code for any recipe in that chapter.
